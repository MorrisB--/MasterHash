## About
---
MasterHash is a password manager that allows a user to have an almost infinite amount of passwords while only using their main one. What will make this product different from others on the market is that it will all be stored in one encrypted file which will allow easy transport.
The software is written mainly in Java, with the GUI written in JavaFX.

## Issues
---
Try searching for your issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/MorrisB--/MasterHash/issues) to see if anyone else has posted about a similar issue about the bug you have found too. If someone has, you can upvote the issue by replying to it with "+1" as your message.

If you can't find any relevant issues on GitHub, then create a new issue (see below) and our development team will take a look at your problem.

### Creating a New Issues
---
Crafting a good issue will make it much easier for the dev team to replicate and resolve your problem. Follow these steps to do it right:

1. Go to our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/MorrisB--/MasterHash/issues) page and click on New Issue.

2. Write a meaningful title that describes the issue. Some good examples are *Logging in from the News and Field Guide pages doesn't redirect properly (using e-mail)* and *Typo: "for" instead of "while" loop*; bad examples include *A bug, HELP!!!!!* and *I found this bug in a Challenge*.

3. Keep the title relatively short, the description is for further information. One example is to shorten long Challenge names, so instead of writing *Test case bug in 'Challenge: Check Radio Buttons and Checkboxes by Default'*, you might want to write *Test case bug in 'Radio Buttons' Challenge*.

4. In the body, **provide a link** to the page on which you encountered this issue.
5. Describe the problem and provide steps so that a developer can try to replicate the issue. Include your operating system and browser version.
6. When referencing other issues or pull requests, simply write #issue/pr-number.
7. **Take a screenshot** of the issue and include it in the post.
8. Include **error message** if there is any.
9. Click **Submit New Issue** and you are done! You will be automatically subscribed to notifications for any updates or future comments.
